# ⏰ Sanrio Digital Clock

A soft pink digital clock inspired by Sanrio aesthetics and coquette-core design styles. This project is a small experiment in blending code with personality.

## 🌸 About

This clock was designed to look like something you'd find on a cute bedside table—warm, cozy, and a little whimsical. I built this as a way to explore my own visual style in web dev. Not every mini project has to be black-and-white and formal. When there's no client brief, I like to have fun with color, theme, and vibe.

## 💻 Tech & Logic

- Built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**
- Time updates in real time using `setInterval`
- The logic for displaying and updating the clock was written from scratch (not copied or generated)
- The design was planned in **Figma** before being brought to life in code

## 🎨 Why Pink? Why Sanrio?

Because sometimes, developers just want to make things that reflect who they are. This one’s for the cute, dreamy side of me. I wanted to create something light-hearted, and this clock felt like the perfect canvas.
